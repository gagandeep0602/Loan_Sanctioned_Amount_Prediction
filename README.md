# Loan_Sanctioned_Amount_Prediction

**Problem Type** --- Regression Problem Statement.

**Project Aim** --- To predict the amount of loan approved from bank.

**Data Source** --- Hackerearth.

**Steps Followed** --- 
1. Explotary Data Analysis.
2. Feature Engineering.
3. Feature Selection.
4. Model creation. 

**Learnings** --- 
1. Learnt how to handle missing values .
2. Depict feature importance and how to remove features having high correlation.
3. Handled outliers by identifying  there importance .
4. Handled categorical features explore different techniques to encode categorical features.
5. Feature selection techniques explored.
6. Tried to imporve model performance by performing hyperparameter tuning.


**Algorithms Tried** ---
1. Lasso Regression.
2. Ridge Regression.
3. Random Forest.
4. XGBoost
5. Linear Regression.

**Others**-- 
1. The reason to choose this dataset was large number of null values, presence of categorial features and numerical features, data  set was little lengthy containing records in lakhs.
2. Tried to learn all techniques in depth used different techniques for encoding and outliers.
3. .We divided dataset into 3 different dataset ,one dataset  was not containing any null values , other dataset was containing  scaled data and no null values  and third one was containing only those features having high importance in order to get high performance in our model.
4. We tried to do hyperparameter tuning of each algorithm used.
